# Facial Emotion Recognition: Understanding Human Expressions

This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify facial expressions into emotion categories (e.g., Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral, Surprise, Ahego).  
The model was built with **Python**, **TensorFlow/Keras**, and **OpenCV**, with preprocessing and augmentation techniques applied to improve accuracy.

## Project Overview
- **Goal**: Train a machine learning model to recognize human facial emotions from labeled image data.
- **Approach**:
  1. Load and preprocess image data (resizing, grayscale conversion, normalization)
  2. Apply data augmentation (rotation, zoom, horizontal flip)
  3. Build a CNN architecture using TensorFlow/Keras
  4. Train and evaluate the model
  5. Analyze results with confusion matrices and accuracy/loss plots
